This article is helpful because it correlates with what was stated in the lecture. You need to know what steps you will take when building a computer and you need to follow the best steps for what you require. Determine what you will be using your computer for and then research products.
Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
One may not be better than the other but depending on what you intend to use your computer for, one may be better for your needs. For example, gamers usually want faster speeds.
Having more cores allows you to do more tasks. Greater speeds allow more data to be processed. 
What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
You need a motherboard compatible with your processor. Also, your motherboard determines what kind of RAM is supported.
What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
You need to determine how fast you would like your drive, how much memory you would like for it to hold, and that it is compatible with your motherboard. 
Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
The motherboard, RAM, CPU and the extensions are the main parts. These help determine what your computer will be capable of doing, the storage you will have, the speed at which it works, etc.

## Things I want to know more about:
  I need to learn more about Core and Speed.
  I need to learn more about the components of a computer.
  What is the difference between PCI and PCIe???
